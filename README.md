Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've provided Python solutions for the A2Z Striver Sheet problems. This repository is a comprehensive collection of solutions, covering various topics and difficulty levels as outlined in the A2Z Striver Sheet.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into different categories as follows:

1. **Patterns**
2. **Basic Math Solutions**
3. **Sorting Solutions**
4. **Hashing Solutions**
5. **Recursion Solutions**
6. **Arrays (Easy)**
